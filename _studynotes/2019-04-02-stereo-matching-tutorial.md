- This is a detailed tutorial on stereo vision, just go study it: 
[Stereo Vision: Algorithms and Applications](http://vision.deis.unibo.it/~smatt/Seminars/StereoVision.pdf);

- This is a course [Learning-based dense depth estimation from stereo and monocular images (2019) ](http://vision.disi.unibo.it/~mpoggi/teaching.html), provided by Dr. MATTEO POGGI. 
I found it helpful to beginers in stereo matching.
