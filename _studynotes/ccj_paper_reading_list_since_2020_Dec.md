## Up-to-date List

- The following may not be updated timely. See the [up-to-date paper list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1b-l2CFNit2_48byQi_7OiYX0HXB82kN6BcQa6arjkWo/edit?usp=sharing).

## Computer Vision Track: CVPR, ICCV, ECCV etc

- The following includs computer vision based papers. 

- Even thouhg some of them apear in NIPS etc, they will fall into this category if their main content is vision based or engineering based (instead of mathematic ones).

|000006 | [PointNet: Deep Learning on Point Sets for 3D Classification and Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1612.00593.pdf) | CVPR 2017 | PointNet, as a novel type of neural network, directly consumes point clouds, which well respects the permutation invariance of points in the input. PointNet provides a unified architecture for applications ranging from object classification, part segmentation, to scene semantic parsing. Though simple, PointNet is highly efficient and effective

|000005| [Bi3D: Stereo Depth Estimation via Binary Classifications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.07274.pdf) | CVPR 2020 | a method that estimates depth via a series of binary classifications. Rather than testing if objects are at a particular depth D, as existing stereo methods do, it classifies them as being closer or farther than D. This property offers a powerful mechanism to balance accuracy and latency.| [code](https://github.com/NVlabs/Bi3D),
