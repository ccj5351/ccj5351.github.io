<table><tbody><tr style="font-weight:bold">  <td align="left">Index</td>  <td align="left">Questions</td>  <td align="left">Short Answer</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">1</td>  <td align="left">What is the full form of OOPS?</td>  <td align="left">Object Oriented Programming System.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">2</td>  <td align="left">What is a class?</td>  <td align="left">Class is a <code>blueprint</code> which reflects the entities attributes and actions. Technically defining a class is designing an user defined data type.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">3</td>  <td align="left">What is an object?</td>  <td align="left">An instance of the class is called as an object.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">4</td>  <td align="left">List the types of inheritance supported in C++.</td>  <td align="left">Single, Multilevel, Multiple, Hierarchical and Hybrid.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">5</td>  <td align="left">List the modes of inheritance</td>  <td align="left">1) <code>Public</code> mode (<code>CCJ: identity map</code>): If we derive a sub class from a public base class. Then the public member of the base class will become public in the derived class and protected members of the base class will become protected in derived class. 2) <code>Protected</code> mode (<code>CCJ: protect children</code>): If we derive a sub class from a Protected base class. Then both public member and protected members of the base class will become protected in derived class. 3) <code>Private</code> mode (<code>CCJ: private 'takes' all</code>): If we derive a sub class from a Private base class. Then both public member and protected members of the base class will become Private in derived class.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">6</td>  <td align="left">What is the role of protected access specifier?</td>  <td align="left">If a class member is protected then it is accessible in the inherited class. However, outside the class, both the private and protected members are not accessible.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">7</td>  <td align="left">What is <code>encapsulation</code>?</td>  <td align="left">The process of binding the data and the functions acting on the data together in an entity (class) called as encapsulation.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">8</td>  <td align="left">What is abstraction?</td>  <td align="left">Abstraction refers to hiding the internal implementation and exhibiting only the necessary details, i.e., the interface.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">9</td>  <td align="left">What is inheritance?</td>  <td align="left">Inheritance is the process of acquiring the properties of the exiting class into the new class. The existing class is called as <code>base/parent</code> class and the inherited class is called as <code>derived/child</code> class.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">10</td>  <td align="left">Explain the purpose of the keyword volatile.</td>  <td align="left">Declaring a variable <code>volatile</code>(易挥发的, 易变的) directs the compiler that the variable can be changed <code>externally</code>. Hence avoiding compiler optimization on the variable reference.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">11</td>  <td align="left">What is an inline function?</td>  <td align="left">A function prefixed with the keyword <code>inline</code> before the function definition is called as inline function. The inline functions are faster in execution when compared to normal functions as the compiler treats inline functions as macros.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">12</td>  <td align="left">What is a storage class?</td>  <td align="left">Storage class specifies the life or scope of symbols such as variable or functions.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">13</td>  <td align="left">Mention the storage classes names in C++.</td>  <td align="left">The following are storage classes supported in C++ : auto, static, extern, register and mutable</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">14</td>  <td align="left">What is the role of <code>mutable storage</code> class specifier?</td>  <td align="left">The <code>mutable</code> specifier applies only to class objects. It allows a member of an object to override const member function. That is, a mutable member can be modified by a const member function.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">15</td>  <td align="left">Difference between Shallow and Deep copy of a class</td>  <td align="left">Shallow Copy stores the references of objects to the original memory address. Deep copy truly clones the underlying data. It is not shared between the first and therefore the copy. Deep copy is achieved using <code>copy constructor</code> and or overloading assignment operator.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">16</td>  <td align="left">What is a pure virtual function?</td>  <td align="left">A virtual function with no function body and assigned with a value zero is called as pure virtual function. E.g., <code>virtual int area() = 0;</code> from the class <code>Shape</code></td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">17</td>  <td align="left">What is an abstract class in C++?</td>  <td align="left">A class with at least one pure virtual function is called as abstract class. We <code>cannot instantiate</code> an abstract class.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">18</td>  <td align="left">What is a reference variable in C++?</td>  <td align="left">A reference variable is an <code>alias name</code> for the existing variable. That means both the variable name and reference variable point to the same memory location. Therefore updating on the original variable can be achieved using reference variable too.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">19</td>  <td align="left">What is the role of <code>static</code> keyword on class member variable?</td>  <td align="left">A <code>static</code> variable does exit though the objects for the respective class are not created. Static member variable share a common memory across all the objects created for the respective class. A static member variable can be referred using the class name itself.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">20</td>  <td align="left">Explain the static member function.</td>  <td align="left">A static member function can be invoked using the class name as it does exist before class objects comes into existence. <code>It can access only static members of the class.</code></td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">21</td>  <td align="left">Name the data type which can be used to store wide characters in C++.</td>  <td align="left"><code>wchar_t</code></td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">22</td>  <td align="left">What are/is the operator/operators used to access the class members?</td>  <td align="left">Dot (.) and Arrow ( -&gt; ). The dot operator is applied to the actual object. The arrow (-&gt;) operator is used with a pointer to an object.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">23</td>  <td align="left">Can we initialize a class/structure member variable as soon as the same is defined?</td>  <td align="left">No, Defining a class/structure is just a type definition and will not allocated memory for the same.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">24</td>  <td align="left">What is the data type to store the Boolean value?</td>  <td align="left"><code>bool</code>, is the new primitive data type introduced in C++ language.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">25</td>  <td align="left">What is function overloading?</td>  <td align="left">Defining several functions with the same name with unique list of parameters is called as function overloading. You <code>cannot</code> overload function declarations that differ only by <code>return type</code>.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">26</td>  <td align="left">What is operator overloading?</td>  <td align="left">Defining a new job for the existing operator w.r.t the class objects is called as operator overloading.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">27</td>  <td align="left">Do we have a String primitive data type in C++?</td>  <td align="left">No, it’s a class from STL (Standard template library).</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">28</td>  <td align="left">Name the default standard streams in C++.</td>  <td align="left">cin, cout, cerr and clog.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">29</td>  <td align="left">Which access specifier/s can help to achieve data hiding in C++?</td>  <td align="left">Private &amp; Protected.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">30</td>  <td align="left">When a class member is defined outside the class, which operator can be used to associate the function definition to a particular class?</td>  <td align="left">Scope resolution operator <code>(::)</code></td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">31</td>  <td align="left">What is a destructor? Can it be overloaded?</td>  <td align="left">A destructor is the member function of the class which is having the same name as the class name and prefixed with <code>tilde (~)</code> symbol. It gets executed automatically w.r.t the object as soon as the object loses its scope. It cannot be overloaded and the only form is without the parameters.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">32</td>  <td align="left">What is a constructor?</td>  <td align="left">A constructor is the member function of the class which is having the same name as the class name and gets executed automatically as soon as the object for the respective class is created.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">33</td>  <td align="left">What is a default constructor? Can we provide one for our class?</td>  <td align="left">Every class does have a constructor provided by the compiler if the programmer doesn’t provides one and known as <code>default constructor</code>. A programmer provided constructor with no parameters is also called as default constructor. In such case compiler doesn’t provides the constructor.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">34</td>  <td align="left">Which operator can be used in C++ to allocate dynamic memory?</td>  <td align="left"><code>‘new’</code> is the operator can be used for the same.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">35</td>  <td align="left">What is the purpose of ‘delete’ operator?</td>  <td align="left"><code>‘delete’</code> operator is used to release the dynamic memory which was created using <code>‘new’</code> operator.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">36</td>  <td align="left">Can I use <code>malloc()</code> function of C language to allocate dynamic memory in C++?</td>  <td align="left">Yes, as C is the subset of C++</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">37</td>  <td align="left">Can I use ‘delete’ operator to release the memory which was allocated using malloc() function of C language?</td>  <td align="left">No, we need to use <code>free()</code> of C language for the same.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">38</td>  <td align="left">What is a friend function?</td>  <td align="left">A function which is not a member of the class but still can access all the members of the class is called so. To make it happen we need to declare within the required class following the keyword <code>‘friend’</code>.</td></tr><tr>  <td align="left">39</td>  <td align="left">What is a copy constructor?</td>  <td align="left">A copy constructor is the constructor which take the same class object reference as the parameter.
