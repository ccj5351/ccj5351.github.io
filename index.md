## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at <a href = "http://www.stevens.edu" target = "_blank"> 
Stevens Institute of Technology</a>, working with <a href = "https://www.cs.stevens.edu/~mordohai/index.html" target = "_blank"> 
Professor Philippos Mordohai, </a> in the field of computer vision and machine learning. Specifically, I am focusing on 
the generalization and robustness in deep learning based stereo depth estimation.

Prior to attending Stevens, I received my Bachelor's Degree of Engineering from 
<a href = "http://www.nwpu.edu.cn/" target = "_blank"> Northwestern Polytechnical University</a>, 
and pursued Master's Degree at <a href = "http://www.xjtu.edu.cn" target = "_blank"> Xi'an Jiaotong University</a>, 
in China.
