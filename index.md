## About Me

I am serving as a Sr. Research Engineer in 3D Computer Vision, at InnoPeak Technology, Inc. (a.k.a. OPPO US Research Center), Palo Alto, CA, to solve problems in 3D reconstruction and Augmented Reality via leveraging my knowledge in Computer Vision and Machine Learning.

I received my Ph.D. degree of Computer Science from <a href = "http://www.stevens.edu" target = "_blank"> 
Stevens Institute of Technology</a>, with the guidance of my advisor, <a href = "https://mordohai.github.io/" target = "_blank"> 
Professor Philippos Mordohai, </a> in the field of computer vision, focusing on 3D reconstruction by binocular and multi-view stereo matching.

Prior to attending Stevens, I received my Bachelor's Degree of Engineering from 
<a href = "http://en.nwpu.edu.cn/" target = "_blank"> Northwestern Polytechnical University</a>, 
and pursued Master's Degree at <a href = "http://en.xjtu.edu.cn/" target = "_blank"> Xi'an Jiaotong University</a>, 
in China.
